# Introduction
This repository contains a modernized and extended version of [neo4jd3.js](https://github.com/eisman/neo4jd3), a UI component that displays a network graph using the [d3.js](https://d3js.org) library. It is written in TypeScript and contains a React wrapper.

Please note that this is not a reusable component. It is just sample code that I published because it took me quite a while to write due to limited availability of up-to-date documentation and sample code, and therefore it might be helpful to others.
